- **User API:** To manage user data and authentication.
- **Order API:** To handle order placements, payments, and order tracking.

## Steps to Build

1. **Frontend Setup:** Use React.js to build the user interface of the eCommerce platform.
2. **Backend API Development:** Use Node.js and Express.js to create RESTful APIs for handling products, orders, and users.
3. **Payment Gateway Integration:** Implement Stripe and Razorpay payment methods for online transactions.
4. **Admin Dashboard:** Develop an admin interface for managing products and orders.
5. **Database Management:** Use MongoDB to store product, user, and order data.
6. **Deployment:** After completing the development, deploy the project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for production.

## Deployment

Once the full stack (frontend and backend) is completed, deploy the project using Vercel to make it accessible to anyone.
